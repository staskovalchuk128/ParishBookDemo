<h1>ParishBook program description</h1>
<p>This program is designed to take into account data about parishioners in the church. In this repository, I have posted a partial source code of this program, in particular the client part. This program also has a server part that was written for Linux OS using the boost ASIO library, but I will not publish the server part of this program in this repository due to security reasons for my clients' data.</p>
<p><strong>Below are some screenshots that show what this program looks like.</strong></p>

<h3>Login window</h3>
<p>This program has an authorization window that eliminates the possibility of unauthorized access to church data. The user has only 4 attempts to enter the correct password, if he entered the wrong password 4 times, then this account will be blocked and the user will have to contact the administrator to unlock his account.</p>
